# Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

A string is a  *valid parentheses string*  (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of `"("` and `")"` characters only, and:

- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
- It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.

We can similarly define the  *nesting depth*  `depth(S)` of any VPS `S` as follows:

- depth("") = 0
- depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
- depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.

For example, `""`, `"()()"`, and `"()(()())"` are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and `")("` and `"(()"` are not VPS's.

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences `A` and `B`, such that `A` and `B` are VPS's (and `A.length + B.length = seq.length`). The subsequences may not necessarily be contiguous.

For example, for the sequence `123456789`, one possible split is:

- A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9},
- B = {2, 4, 6, 8}.

This corresponds to the output `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`  where 0 indicates membership in `A` and 1 indicates membership in `B`.

Now choose  **any**  such `A` and `B` such that `max(depth(A), depth(B))` is the minimum possible value.

Return an `answer` array (of length `seq.length`) that encodes such a choice of `A` and `B`:  `answer[i] = 0` if `seq[i]` is part of `A`, else `answer[i] = 1`.  Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: seq = "(()())"
Output: [0,1,1,1,1,0]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: seq = "()(())()"
Output: [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= seq.size <= 10000

        answer = []
        depth = 0

        for ch in seq:
            if ch == '(':
                depth += 1
                answer.append(depth % 2)
            else:
                answer.append(depth % 2)
                depth -= 1

        return answer
```
